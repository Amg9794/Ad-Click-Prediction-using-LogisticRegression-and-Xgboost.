## 1. Business Problem <a name="business-problem"></a>

### 1.1 Problem Description <a name="problem-description"></a>

**Introduction:**

Clickthrough rate (CTR) is a vital metric used in online advertising to measure the effectiveness of ads. CTR represents the ratio of how often people who view an ad end up clicking on it. It is calculated as the number of clicks divided by the number of impressions. For example, if you have 5 clicks and 100 impressions, your CTR would be 5%.

High CTR indicates that users find your ads relevant and engaging. It also impacts your ad's position and cost in advertising platforms like Google Ads.

In this project, we aim to predict the click-through rate (pCTR) of ads using machine learning models. Accurate pCTR predictions are essential for ranking ads and pricing clicks in online advertising.

### 1.3 Real-world/Business Objectives and Constraints <a name="real-worldbusiness-objectives-and-constraints"></a>

**Objective:** Predict the pClick (probability of click) as accurately as possible.

**Constraints:**
- Low latency: Predictions should be made quickly to respond to user interactions.
- Interpretability: The model's predictions should be understandable and explainable.

## 2. Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>

Search advertising is a major revenue source for the internet industry. Accurately predicting the click-through rate (CTR) of ads is crucial for ranking ads and pricing clicks. In this project, we will use machine learning techniques, specifically Logistic Regression and XGBoost, to predict the probability of a user clicking on an ad (pCTR).
